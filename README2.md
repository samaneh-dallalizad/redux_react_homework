# Homework

In this assignment you'll create a React app that uses both local state and Redux state. 

**Read the assignment carefully! Do not deviate from the assignment!**

_Note: we'll use the results of this homework assignment for a formal evaluation and as such you should write the code individually. **Plagiarism is a violation of the Academy contract and is not in your best interest. Do not discuss the contents of the assignment with your fellow students.**_

## How to submit your results
**Send your homework to teachers@codaisseur.com before Saturday 22:00**

Clean up your code: 
- Fix the formatting/indentation
- Remove unnecessary code.

The app should be runnable simply by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies, and running `npm run start`.

## Step 0 - Setup

Create a React app and add the Redux integration. Read about it [here](https://readest.codaisseur.com/courses/intermediate-bootcamp/09-redux/03-react-redux/01-setup) if you forgot how to do it.

### Requirements

1. Make sure to add/enable the Redux Developer Tools in your `store.js`.
1. Clean up the provided `App` component by removing everything inside the `<div className="App">` element.

## Step 1 - Render some elements

The following references should have enough information to complete this step:
1. [Introducing JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
1. [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

### Requirements
1. Write all the JSX and JavaScript for this step inside the `App.js`. Do not create a new module.
1. Use the following JavaScript data object (containing home computer models), render a `<select>` element which contains all the items in the object as `<option>` elements. Actually use the data in the object and _do not hard-code the HTML into your render method._
1. The `<option>` elements should have a label with both the name of the model and the year. 
1. The elements should also have a `value` attribute consisting of only the name. 
1. Add an extra default `<option>` element at the beginning (see the expected HTML below).

```js
const data = {
  "Ivel Z3": {
    manufacturer: "Ivasim",
    year: 1969,
    origin: "Croatia"
  },
  "Bally Astrocade": {
    manufacturer: "Bally Consumer Products",
    year: 1977,
    origin: "USA"
  },
  "Sord M200 Smart Home Computer": {
    manufacturer: "Sord Computer Corporation",
    year: 1971,
    origin: "Japan"
  },
  "Commodore 64": {
    manufacturer: "Commodore",
    year: 1982,
    origin: "USA"
  }
}
```

When inspecting the resulting HTML with DevTools, it should look like this:

```HTML
<!-- Expected Output -->
<select>
    <option value="">-- pick a model --</option>
    <option value="Ivel Z3">Ivel Z3 (1969)</option>
    <option value="Bally Astrocade">Bally Astrocade (1977)</option>
    <option value="Sord M200 Smart Home Computer">Sord M200 Smart Home Computer (1971)</option>
    <option value="Commodore 64">Commodore 64 (1982)</option>
</select>
```

_Notice the year in parentheses_

## Step 2 - Event handling and local state

Now turn the `<select>` element into a controlled component.

Add an event handler to your `<select>` element, so that whenever the value of the drop-down changes we run a method called `updateSelection`.

Add the `updateSelection` method to the `App` component class. Inside the method save the selected value in the **local state**. Use these references, if necessary:

1. [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
1. [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
1. [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) <-- especially this one

### Requirements

At the end of this step, changing the selected item of the drop-down should update the `App` component's local state and store the selected value. Also, the value of the `<select>` element should be read from the local state.

## Step 3 - Redux Actions

Now that we can select a computer model from the drop-down, you will add a button which adds the selected item to an array in the Redux state.

Your initial Redux state should be an empty array `[]`. Look at [this section of the reader for an example](https://readest.codaisseur.com/courses/intermediate-bootcamp/09-redux/02-redux/05-array-reducer). Define a new action type which has, as its payload, the object containing all the data for the selected computer model. This is what it should look like from your Redux Dev Tools:

![action details](https://cd.sseu.re/React_App_-_Google_Chrome_2018-06-20_11.14.58.png)

Implement the reducer so that it handles the action and adds the selected data to the state. The state will look like this after several items have been added:

![state after 3 additions](https://cd.sseu.re/React_App_-_Google_Chrome_2018-06-20_11.16.40.png)

## Step 4 - Reading from the Redux state

If you haven't already: define a `mapStateToProps` function. It should return an object containing the list of selected items (which it gets from the Redux state). Make sure you use it while connecting your `App` component to Redux.

Now that you have the data as props, create a component in your project responsible for rendering each of the items.

### Requirements
1. Connect your `App` component to Redux.
1. Use a `mapStateToProps` function to select the necessary data from the Redux state.
1. The component used to render the item details should be called `ModelDetails`. The component is responsible for rendering a _single_ item.
1. You will have to use `connect` from `react-redux` on one of your components. However, do **NOT** connect the `ModelDetails` component, it should remain "dumb" and only contain UI code.
1. Add `propTypes` that check/validate whether the name, manufacturer, year, and origin are correctly being passed to `ModelDetails`.

_This is an example of what the HTML output should look like:_

```html
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: Ivel Z3</li>
    <li>Manufacturer: Ivasim</li>
    <li>Year: 1969</li>
    <li>Origin: Croatia</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

_Notice that the name is expected as a prop. However, the name property doesn't exist in each individual data object. Try adding it to the data in the Redux state._


## Final Result

Will look and behave something like this:
